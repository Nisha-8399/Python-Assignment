# Practical Example 1: How does the Python code structure work?
'''Python code structure is quite flexible and easy to understand. It follows an indentation-based block structure, which makes the code clean and readable. 
Here’s a breakdown of Python’s code structure:

1. Modules and Scripts :
Python code is typically written in scripts (.py files) or organized into modules (reusable code files that can be imported into other scripts).

2. Indentation and Blocks :
Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code, unlike other languages that use curly braces {}. Typically, four spaces per indentation level are recommended.

3. Statements and Expressions :
Statements are instructions that perform actions (e.g., assignments, loops, function calls).
Expressions are parts of statements that evaluate to a value

4. Functions and Classes
Functions and classes help in code reusability.

Functions are defined using the def keyword.
Classes define objects and are created using the class keyword.

5. Control Structures :
Python supports:

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
Loops (for, while)
Exception handling (try, except, finally)

6. Importing Modules
Python allows importing built-in and user-defined modules.

7. File Handling
Python provides file operations like reading and writing.

8. Comments
Python uses # for single-line comments and triple quotes for multi-line comments.
